Part 7
-----------------------------------
- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?
- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?
-----------------------------------

Code reviews should take the stance of a person very ignorant of what you're doing.
Code should be written so that an ignorant person could come in and be brought up to speed very quickly.
I appreciate code that I can understand quickly. I get frustrated when I can't understand whats going on. Each line
of code shouldn't require a google search. More documentation is usually a good thing. I appreciate a fresh set of eyes as sometimes
something I believe to be obvious is actually confusing.

Containers allow us to better utilize all of the computers. Rather than each computer being dedicated to one specific program/server,
we can use containers to wrap our programs in an operating system using containers. This is a further layer of abstraction, but boosts our 
reproducibility and should save both time and money.
